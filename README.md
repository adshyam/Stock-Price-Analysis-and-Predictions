Amazon Stock Price predictions using LSTM

This project aims to predict stock prices using an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model. The model is trained on historical stock price data and is capable of 
forecasting future stock prices given a starting stock price input.

Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of historical stock price data. The dataset contains the following columns:
Date: The date of the stock price record
Open: The opening price of the stock on that day
High: The highest price reached during the day
Low: The lowest price reached during the day
Close: The closing price of the stock on that day
Volume: The trading volume of the stock on that day
Name: The name or symbol of the company associated with the stock


Preprocessing
Before training the RNN model, the dataset is preprocessed to prepare it for input. The preprocessing steps include feature selection, normalization, and scaling. 
These steps ensure the best results from the RNN model.

RNN Model
The RNN model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. It utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and retain
information over time. The model architecture consists of multiple LSTM layers and fully connected dense layers.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and the root mean squared error loss function. The Adam optimizer is well-suited for training deep neural networks, 
and the root mean squared error loss function is commonly used for regression tasks.

Training
The model is trained on the preprocessed stock price dataset. The training process involves feeding the input sequences to the model and adjusting the model's 
weights based on the prediction error. The number of epochs and batch size are configurable parameters that determine the duration and efficiency of the training process.

Evaluation
After training the model, its performance is evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE). This metric provide insights into the accuracy and performance of the 
model in predicting stock prices.

Forecasting
The trained RNN model can be used to forecast future stock prices. Given a starting stock price as input, the model generates predictions for future time periods. 
The forecasted stock prices can be useful for making investment decisions and analyzing market trends.

Usage
To use the stock price prediction model, follow these steps:

Ensure that the required dependencies (TensorFlow, Keras, etc.) are installed.
Prepare the historical stock price dataset in the specified format.
Preprocess the dataset by running the preprocessing steps outlined in the code.
Build and train the RNN model using the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Utilize the trained model for forecasting future stock prices by providing a starting stock price input.

Limitations
Stock price prediction is a challenging task, and the accuracy of predictions can vary depending on various factors such as market conditions, external events, 
and data quality.
The model's performance is based on historical data and may not accurately reflect future market trends.
It's important to consider other factors, such as fundamental analysis and market research, when making investment decisions.

Conclusion
This project provides a framework for stock price prediction using an RNN model. By leveraging historical stock price data and deep learning techniques, the model can 
generate forecasts for future stock prices. However, it's crucial to interpret the predictions cautiously and consider other factors when making financial decisions.
